Creating Enhanced Simple Calculator with History in Python

## Problem Statement: Enhanced Simple Calculator with History

You are tasked with creating an enhanced console-based calculator program in Python. This calculator not only 
performs basic arithmetic operations but also maintains a history of operations performed.

**Features:**

`Addition` - Allow the user to add two numbers.

`Subtraction` - Allow the user to subtract one number from another.

`Multiplication` - Allow the user to multiply two numbers.

`Division` - Allow the user to divide one number by another.

`Display Operations` - Allow the user to view the history of operations performed.

`Quit` - Allow the user to exit the program.


## Example:

===== Enhanced Simple Calculator =====
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Display Operations
6. Quit

Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5/6): 1

Enter the first number: 10

Enter the second number: 5

Result: 10 + 5 = 15
